     <h3>Cooking Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine the Rub ingredients and rub onto both sides of the ribs (most on meaty side). Set aside to marinate for 20 minutes (or overnight).</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 160°C</li>
            <li>Place ribs on a tray in a single layer. Pour apple cider underneath the ribs, cover with foil then bake for 1 hour 30 minutes or until the meat is pretty tender</li>
            <li>Remove from oven, turn up to 180°C/350°F. Remove foil, drizzle with olive oil, then return ribs to oven for 15 minutes or until rub becomes nice and crusty.</li>
            <li>Line a new tray with foil then baking paper.</li>
            <li>Remove ribs from oven, transfer to lined tray. Pour any juices from tray over the ribs.</li>
            <li>Flip ribs so the bonier side is up. Slather with Barbecue Sauce, then bake 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove from oven, then turn ribs over so the meaty side is up. Slather with Barbecue Sauce, bake 5 minutes. Repeat 2 or 3 more times until you've got a thick glaze on the ribs.</li>
            <li>Cut ribs into individual or multiple rib portions and serve with remaining Barbcue Sauce!</li>
        </ol>
    <h3>Barbecue Sauce Stpes</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Place all ingredients in a saucepan and simmer over medium heat, stirring occasionally, for 45 minutes or until thickened.</li>
            <li>Adjust to taste: sweetness with brown sugar / honey, salt and sour with vinegar. Use for glazing ribs and as a sauce for serving.</li>
